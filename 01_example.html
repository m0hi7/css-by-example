<!--  guys in this code series you will learn different concepts of intermediate CSS. For better understanding run all code of this code series in browser. -->

<!-- I think you already know about selectors like universal selector(*), element selctor, id selector, group selector ....  but in this code you  learn about combinators in css.

let's take a look at combinators. 

combinators : is somthing that explains the relationship between the selectors.

There are four different combinators :- 
1. Descendant combinator ->       (white space)
2. Child combinator ->            ( > ) 
3. Adjacent sibling combinator -> ( + )
4. General sibling combinator ->  ( ~ )

-->

<!-- 1. Descendant combinator -> (white space) : as name suggested descendant("purvaj") it will select all child elements   as well as its super child elements -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>CSS BY EXAMPLES</title>
    <style>
      div p {
        /*  use of descendant combinator by using a white space between div and p */
        background-color: rgb(255, 212, 167);
        color: rgb(14, 29, 74);
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Descendant combinator</h2>

    <p>
      The descendant combinator matches all elements that are descendants of a
      specified element.
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>child 1 in the div.</p>
      <p>child 2 in the div.</p>
      <section><p>super child in the div.</p></section>
    </div>

    <p>sibling 1 of a div.</p>
    <p>sibling 2 of a div.</p>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- TASK : Add a super child element in this code and apply css on it by using descendant combinator. -->
